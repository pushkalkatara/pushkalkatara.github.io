Hi there! I'm a 2nd-year Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute, working with Prof. Katerina Fragkiadaki. My research focuses on enabling embodied agents to learn from internet-scale data.

Prior to joining CMU, I was working with Prof. K. Madhava Krishna at Robotics Research Center, IIIT-Hyderabad on Visual Servoing. I also worked as a Computer Vision Engineer at Clutterbot building perception systems for home robots.

During my undergrad, I contributed to JdeRobot through Google Summer of Code working with Prof. Jose Maria Canas Plaza. Additionally, I led the research team at SRMAUV, building computer vision stack for autonomous underwater vehicles.

Apart from research, I find joy in hiking and playing keyboard/guitar. Connect with me at pkatara@andrew.cmu.edu. Let's chat!

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
